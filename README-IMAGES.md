## Quick Start

### Option 1: Python Script (Recommended)
```bash

### Option 2: Bash Script
```bash
# 1. Set your OpenAI API key

2. Sign in to your OpenAI account
3. Click "Create new secret key"
4. Copy the key and set it as an environment variable

## What the Scripts Do

Both scripts will:
- ‚úÖ Generate 16 photorealistic images using DALL-E 3
- ‚úÖ Save them to `/public/images/` with proper filenames
- ‚úÖ Skip existing images (won't regenerate)
- ‚úÖ Show progress and success/failure counts
- ‚úÖ Handle errors gracefully

## Generated Images

The scripts will create these 16 images:

### Party Gallery (6 images)
- `princess-party-magic.jpg` - Princess themed birthday party
- `superhero-squad.jpg` - Kids in superhero costumes
- `face-painting-fun.jpg` - Professional face painter at work
- `birthday-cake-moment.jpg` - Birthday child blowing out candles
- `play-area-adventures.jpg` - Kids playing in playground equipment

## Cost Estimate

DALL-E 3 pricing (as of 2024):
- Standard quality (1024√ó1024): $0.040 per image
- **Total cost for 16 images: ~$0.64**

## Troubleshooting

### "Command not found: python"
Try `python3` instead of `python`

### "Permission denied" on bash script
Run: `chmod +x generate-images.sh`

### API Key Issues
- Make sure your OpenAI account has billing set up
- Check that your API key is correct and active
- Ensure you have sufficient credits

### Image Generation Fails
- Check your internet connection
- Verify your OpenAI API key is valid
- Some prompts might be rejected - the script will continue with others

## After Generation

Once images are generated:

1. **Review Images**: Check `/public/images/` folder
2. **Test Website**: Run `npm run dev` to see images in action
3. **Update Components**: Follow `update-images.md` guide
4. **Commit Changes**: 
   ```bash
   git add public/images/
   git commit -m "üì∏ Add DALL-E 3 generated images"
   git push origin main
   ```

## Image Specifications

All generated images will be:
- **Format**: JPG
- **Size**: 1024√ó1024px (optimized for web)
- **Style**: Photorealistic
