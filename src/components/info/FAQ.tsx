        answer: 'No! Our 10-visit punch cards never expire and can be transferred to family or friends. At $13 per visit, you save $20 compared to daily admission.'
      },
      {
        question: 'What if the weather is bad?',
        answer: 'Perfect! We\'re an indoor facility, so weather never affects your visit. We\'re especially busy on rainy, snowy, or extremely hot days when outdoor play isn\'t ideal.'
